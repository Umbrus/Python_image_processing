# Image processing with Python
This project accompanies the course given by the [Science IT Support](http://www.scits.unibe.ch/) unit at Bern University.

It contains as series of Notebooks exposing how to do mostly basic and some advanced image processing using Python. It uses standard packages ([Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Maplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)) and for the image processing parts is heavily based on the [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) package.

Most of the examples datasets are biology microscopy images taken from open repositories and can be downloaded using the [Data_setup_local](https://github.com/guiwitz/Python_image_processing/blob/master/Env_setup/Data_setup_local.ipynb) notebook.

## Installation
One can install all necessary packages manually. However we provide some information to facilitate the installation of all parts (for UNIX machines) in the [Instructions_local.md](https://github.com/guiwitz/Python_image_processing/blob/master/Env_setup/Instructions_local.md) guide.

The course is originally run using a JupyterHub based on [The Littlest JupyterHub](https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/) and installed on a [switchEngine](https://engines.switch.ch). We also give instructions to create such as JupyterHub in the [Instructions_SwitchEngine.md](https://github.com/guiwitz/Python_image_processing/blob/master/Env_setup/Instructions_SwitchEngine.md) guide.
